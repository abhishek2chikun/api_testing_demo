Score: 0.85
Syntax OK: True
Coverage Score: 0.9
Criteria Score: 0.8
Notes (detailed):
The tests cover most of the endpoints and scenarios, but there are missing tests for authentication/authorization enforcement and error responses following API standards. Additionally, the validation for 'OrderIn' is not fully covered. The test for placing an order with missing required fields does not cover all validation cases outlined in the Epic. The README.md is accurate but could include more details on the acceptance criteria. No syntax errors were found, but additional tests are needed to meet the acceptance criteria.
