Notes (detailed):
The tests cover most of the endpoints and scenarios, but the following are missing or need improvement: 1. Missing tests for error responses following API standards (HTTPException envelope and 500 error_id). 2. Missing tests for authentication/authorization enforcement. 3. The validation for 'OrderIn' is not fully covered, particularly for edge cases like invalid order types and missing required fields. 4. The test for the root endpoint does not check for the service metadata as specified in the acceptance criteria.

Refinement triggered-without-changes (avg=0.90 <= 0.90).
