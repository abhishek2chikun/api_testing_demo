Notes (detailed):
The tests cover most of the endpoints and validation scenarios, but there are missing tests for error responses and authentication/authorization enforcement. Additionally, the test for the health check endpoint does not include authentication, which is required. The test for listing orders with an invalid broker should also check for proper error handling. The test for retrieving a valid order does not check for the correct order_id format. Missing tests for 500 error responses and ensuring that the API documentation is accessible.
